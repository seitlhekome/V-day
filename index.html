        “Some loves are loud.  
        Ours feels like a quiet library —  
        warm, timeless, and sacred.”
    </div>

    <div class="letter">
        To Minah Lekau,<br><br>

        Loving you feels like discovering a rare book —  
        one I want to read slowly, carefully,  
        understanding every word, every thought, every dream.  

        I admire the way your mind works —  
        the depth of your thoughts,  
        the seriousness with which you approach your research,  
        the quiet strength behind your ambition.  

        I cannot wait to see you stand in front of a lecture hall,  
        speaking with confidence,  
        shaping minds,  
        building a legacy through knowledge.  

        And I promise this —  
        while you chase your masters, your research, your calling,  
        I will be beside you.  
        Supporting. Encouraging. Loving.  

        One day, after long academic days,  
        we will travel —  
        to old cities with cobbled streets,  
        to rustic cabins with wooden furniture and soft silence,  
        to places where the only thing louder than the wind  
        is our laughter.  

        I do not just love you for today.  
        I love you for the life we are quietly building.
    </div>

    <div class="signature">
        Always yours.

        In every future I imagine —  
        it is you walking beside me.  
        And that is enough.
